## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and
## their may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix
## rather than compute it repeatedly 
##(there are also alternatives to matrix inversion 
##that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write
## a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

##Write the following functions:
##    makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object 
##    that can cache its inverse.
##    cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix"
##    returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already
##    been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
##    then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

##Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function
## in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X)
## returns its inverse.

##For this assignment, assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible.
